### Different architecture

# Suffix
AL - auxiliary loss  
WS = weight sharing  
ASYM = asymmetry

## direct

try to solve by directly extracting features on each digit and then try yo get a classification of the digit

## simple Hres (SHres)

add a simple upsampling + smoothing + sharpening the edge before solving
