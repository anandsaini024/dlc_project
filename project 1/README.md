## number2
upscale data from 14x14 to 28x28
then run LeNet on it  
Upscale idea :  
double the pixel then make the images smoother then apply a threshold to have good edges  
Nearest-neighbor interpolation with the scale of 2 article :

## number4
Revisited LeNET to work on 14x14 images

## nMNIST
LeNet on MNIST data (28x28 images)

## numberRecognition
use encoder/decoder to increase dimension
then use LeNet
